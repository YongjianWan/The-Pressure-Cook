# Stir Wars: Gamified Social Cooking Platform

**Team**: Spice Girls  
**Course**: DECO3500 Social & Mobile Computing  
**Semester**: 2, 2025

## Project Overview

We are developing solutions for people who struggle with cooking motivation and/or skills, dislike cooking alone, and cannot afford frequent dining out. Our approach explores social and contextual computing to create collaborative cooking experiences that build skills and motivation.

## Core Concept

**Domain**: Social cooking for skill-limited, motivation-lacking individuals in shared living spaces  
**Target Users**: International students, shared accommodation residents, novice cooks  
**Key Pain Points**: Skill gaps, social isolation while cooking, unfair task distribution, cleaning burden

## Repository Structure

```

## How to Deploy/Use

### Web Application Prototype
1. Navigate to `prototype/web-app/`
2. Open `index.html` in browser
3. No login required - use demo personas:
   - **Demo User 1**: Efficiency-focused cook
   - **Demo User 2**: Skill-learning beginner
   - **Demo User 3**: Social experience seeker

（maybe）

### Speculative Design Prototype
Located in `prototype/speculative/` - physical classroom activity kit:
- Rule cards for kitchen tools
- Paper ingredients and toy utensils
- Activity facilitation guide

## Key Features

### Current Prototype (Week 9)
- **Skill-based recipe matching**: Recipes adapt to user competency
- **Optional collaboration**: Users can invite friends or cook solo
- **Task trading system**: Exchange cooking/cleaning responsibilities
- **Cultural exchange prompts**: Share food stories and traditions

### Planned Features (Final Delivery)
- **Context-aware guidance**: Real-time cooking assistance
- **Multi-user synchronization**: Coordinated cooking sessions
- **Progress visualization**: Skill development tracking
- **Conflict resolution games**: Playful task assignment

## Research Insights

### User Interview Findings (n=3)
- **Autonomy vs Collaboration**: Users want cooking choice, not forced interaction
- **Learning Motivation**: Strong appetite for skill development with structured pathways
- **Cleaning Pain Point**: Universal dislike, but acceptance levels vary
- **Economic Drivers**: Primary motivator across all user types

### Design Principles
1. **Incentivize, don't mandate** collaboration
2. **Respect cooking autonomy** and personal preferences
3. **Make invisible work visible** (especially cleaning tasks)
4. **Support multiple cooking styles** (efficiency vs experience modes)

## Evaluation Plan

### Week 9 Stand-up Demo
- User research findings presentation
- Low-fidelity prototype walkthrough
- Speculative design activity demonstration

### Final Tradeshow (Week 12)
- Multi-user cooking simulation
- 5-minute live demonstration
- A2 poster with domain analysis and solution overview

## Ethical Considerations

We've assessed our project using the Ethics for Interaction Design framework:

- **Autonomy**: Ensuring users maintain choice in participation levels
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respecting diverse cooking traditions and practices
- **Social Pressure**: Avoiding systems that shame or exclude non-participants
- **Data Privacy**: Protecting user cooking preferences and social connections
